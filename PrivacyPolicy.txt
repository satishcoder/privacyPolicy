Adding a privacy policy to your app's store listing helps provide transparency about how you treat sensitive user and device data. For apps that request access to sensitive permissions or data (as defined in the user data policies): You must link to a privacy policy on your app's store listing page and within your app. Make sure your privacy policy is available on an active URL, applies to your app, and specifically covers user privacy.

For apps in the Designed for Families program: You must link to a privacy policy on your app's store listing page and within your app, regardless of your app's access to sensitive permissions or data. Make sure your privacy policy is available on an active URL, applies to your app, and specifically covers user privacy. For other apps: You're not required to post a privacy policy.
